In this talk, you'll learn how to design and structure a Firebase application that can be re-purposed to multiple platforms (web, server, and mobile clients). We'll walk through the development of an application data model and schema for a sample app including how you can test it in a platform-independent way. We will then show how to package the UI for the app to run in multiple platform environments.",

You can scale up to deal with the excess traffic, but what do you do when your load is variable? How do you do that, and stay on budget? This session is a case study on getting an App Engine app to scale to serve 30,000,000 requests an hour. It will take you through the architecture, the code changes and the technology trade offs to get to that level of traffic.",

With the move to OpenJDK finally aNdroid finally has access to many new language features lambdas, streams, default methods on interfaces and many more. You have listened all those features in Java talks for years, this time come and watch how the new language features and invoke dynamics will change your aNdroid world. Many Android developers has been listening or worst staying away the new Java features for years. Whether they have heard about them or not, android developers are lacking experience on all those not so new language features. This talk will focus on the new-existing language features which will be introduced by version N (or sometime in future) in the most simplest but effective and hands-on way.",
