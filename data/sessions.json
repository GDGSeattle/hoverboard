But why? All in the name of being “well-read”? All just to say “Yeah — I’ve done that”?<br><br>Why do we do what we do? Why do we try so hard? Why are we here, paying to be here, to listen to people talk? Maybe because we’re life long learners - we want to learn new things? Commune with our own kind? But why? Come examine our motives as developers, the pitfalls we fall into, and the cost of being great.",

    "description": "Vendors large and small have offered multiple windows in their Android devices. Now, with Android 7.0, we are getting multiple windows in standard Android... and in the new Android-on-ChromeOS environment. This class will explore how to support multi-window modes in your Android applications, with particular emphasis on the split-screen mode for phones and tablets. We will look at how your app will behave in these environments without any changes and how you can make minor tweaks to improve your results. We will also examine what quirks will be seen with multi-window mode and what sorts of UX decisions you will need to make as a result. Finally, we will see how you can start testing your app in these modes, to begin making tactical changes and run experiments for longer-term strategic choices.",

You'll need to shoehorn your business logic in frameworks that are designed to build games first, not apps -- not a great proposition.<br><br>Let's explore the path less traveled together! In this session, we'll see how you can build VR and AR applications, in Java and Android Studio, thanks to Google's Daydream and Tango Java SDKs, plus a few helpful 3D graphics libraries.",

    "description": "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are the new big thing in web development, but it’s a mistake to simply endorse or reject them. More than a set of technologies, PWAs are about reframing how we build apps for the web and mobile. They’re about building speed and security and responsiveness right into the app instead of relying on fast devices and connections. They’re about making web apps do everything native apps can do without rewriting your entire codebase for different platforms.<br><br>In this talk you’ll learn how to build progressive web apps and decide why you might or might not want to.",
