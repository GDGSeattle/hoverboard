[GDG Seattle Code of Conduct](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-seattle/pages/19210302/Code_of_Conduct/)

GDG Seattle is an inclusive community where developers, designers, and entrepreneurs of all skill levels, genders, religions, and backgrounds welcome to learn, practice, and share Google technologies, services, and platforms. Our motto is:


### Be Excellent To Each Other


Our group is a place for discussion and the open exchange of ideas. We can only achieve this goal if everyone involved feels that they are warmly welcomed and valued participants and that they are in a safe environment. Although we may disagree with each otherâ€™s opinions, we should be able to do so without upsetting or being upset by others.

We therefore do not tolerate verbal comments or presentation material that makes inappropriate use of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. 

We require participants to respect others' boundaries and do not tolerate deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, disruption of sessions, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact: [gdg-seattle-organizers@googlegroups.com](mailto:gdg-seattle-organizers@googlegroups.com)
