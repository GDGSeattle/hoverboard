In this talk, you'll learn how to design and structure a Firebase application that can be re-purposed to multiple platforms (web, server, and mobile clients). We'll walk through the development of an application data model and schema for a sample app including how you can test it in a platform-independent way. We will then show how to package the UI for the app to run in multiple platform environments.",

    "bio" : "Alexis Menard, Software Engineer @Intel. Virtual Reality are gaining momentum amongst consumers, especially with the release of cheaper VR and AR entertainment solutions. Intel is seeing the three technologies as an important growth area for the CCG business as well as in the cloud where the content is stored (see the various initiatives around sports and olympics).  One of the main challenges for VR these days is content delivery which requires giant downloads and complicated app store installation steps, and often involves proprietary stacks which lock users to a particular vendor. Leading VR companies have spent significant resources to create content yet it didn’t proliferate because it was cumbersome for developers to go to market: multiple vendors, multiple SDKs and the need for extensive skillsets.  WebVR is a way to address this challenge. It leverages the power of the web platform -- low friction, discoverability, indexing and an open and easy development environment -- to help deliver rich and entertaining portable experiences. The web doesn’t pose gatekeepers -- you can deploy or instantly update a virtual or augmented reality experience on your website.  WebVR allows developers to easily create virtual experiences that can be seamlessly deployed across different operating systems and browsers without compromising capabilities. In this presentation, we’ll introduce WebVR, its scope and then show how you can create a VR experience quickly using the web platform.",
